# Support_Vector_Machine
Support Vector Machine with Gaussian kernel from scratch without Sklearn 

I have only used numpy for mathematics and pandas for data handling. 
it works on Iris data and it predicts the class versicolor. 

Since the data had 4 dimendsions and it was not linear i used the Gaussian Kernel to calculate the feature vectors and it gives upto 80% accuracy. 
I split the data as training set=80% and test set=20%. 
i normalized the training data. 
and then trained the model with gradient descent
